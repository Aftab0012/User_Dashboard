## Improvements

### If more time were available, there are several potential improvements that could be made to enhance this project:

- Feature Addition: could have added more interactive feature like ( register, login, jwt authentication).

- Optimization: I would have done more optimizationto make more modular if i had given more time.

- Animations: I could have added more 3D and cool looking animations if had given more time.

- Testing: If i had given more time i would have added unit and integration testing.

### In this project i have already added more than neough feature for a (DASHBOARD) app so i think in future i can add more features to this without any problem
